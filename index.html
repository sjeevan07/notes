                <p> HyperText Markup Language(HTML) is a simple markup system used to create hypertext documents
                    that are portable from one platform to another. HTML documents are SGML documents with generic 
                    semantics that are appropriate for representing information from a wide range of applications. HTML
                    markup can represent hypertext news, mail, documentation, and hypermedia; menus of options;
                    database query results; simple structured documents with in-lined graphics; and hypertext views of 
                    existing bodies of information.

                <p>HTML has been in use by the World-Wide Web(WWW) global information initiative since 1990. The 
                    HTML 3.0 specification provides a number of new features, and is broadly backwards compatible with
                    HTML 2.0. It is defined as an application of International Standard ISO ISO8879:1986 Standard
                    Generalized Markup Language (SGML). This specification will be proposed as the Internet Media Type
                    (RFC 1590) and MIME Content Type (RFC 1521) called "text/html; version=3.0"

                    Git is software for tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows (thousands of parallel branches running on different systems). Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for development of the Linux kernel, with other kernel developers contributing to its initial development. Since 2005, Junio Hamano has been the core maintainer. As with most other distributed version control systems, and unlike most clientâ€“server systems, every Git directory on every computer is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full version-tracking abilities, independent of network access or a central server. Git is free and open-source software distributed under GNU General Public License Version 2.
